(Estimated Hours) 8 hours

(Content Insights) I learned to use Joomla with the web hosting CloudAccess.net. I registered a free website https://nostress.joomla.com in joomla.org.
                   A website can be created by the management page https://nostress.joomla.com/administrator/. Without install Joomla on my local computer, the development process is simplified greatly.
		   Creating and publishing a webpage becomes easier. Developers can focus on the website's content.
                   Creating a webpage will use some features in Control Panel like Articles, Modules, Menus, etc. It's different from creating an HTML/CSS webpage. 	   

(Career/Employability/Learning Insights) I spent more time exploring the management page of Joomla and found some useful resource links with screenshots. Searching for useful information is a required skill. 
                                         And much information is redundant. To find the key information quickly is essential. It's helpful to experiment while looking at the guide.

(Estimated Hours) 20 hours

(Content Insights) I learned to install the Joomla locally. Firstly, I installed MAMP, then install the Joomla. MAMP will manage Apache Server and MySQL Server. For the website, I
                   tried to create a category, blogs, and Featured Articles. Many Featured Articles can be displayed on a web page. Then I learned to deploy my website on SiteGround.
		   The deployment process has five steps. The first step is to compress my local Joomla files to the zip package and upload it to SiteGround using File Manager. 
		   The second step is to unzip the zip file using Putty. The third step is to export the local database and upload it to SiteGround. The fourth step is to create a database
                   and user and import the dump file. The fifth step is to modify the database user, password, and database name in configuration.php.		   
                   	   

(Career/Employability/Learning Insights) I spent much time installing the development environment for Joomla. When encountering the problem, searching in SiteGround is helpful. And the file apache_error.log in C:\MAMP\logs\
                                         is useful to provide the error information of MAMP. I think the method that searching for the problem in SiteGround and trying the solution is efficient.
					 


Week5
(Learning Activities) I learned to create a child theme for my WordPress site.

(Estimated Hours) 20 hours

(Content Insights) I learned to create a child theme for my WordPress site. The child theme folder is "twentynineteen-child". And in the folder, there are two files. One is "style.css". The other is "functions.php".
                   All my style changes are in "style.css". And functions.php is used to enqueue "style.css". The child theme is useful because it can inherit the style of the parent theme. And the child theme
		   can change the parent theme's style.
          	   

(Career/Employability/Learning Insights) I spent much time investigating the issue that the child theme doesn't take effect. I tried to create different child themes such as twentynineteen-child and twentytwentyone-child.
                                         I tried to create the child theme in different environments like VVV and "Local By Flywheel". Later, I found my mistake that I created a file named "function.php", other than "functions.php".
					 So the file isn't called.
					 
					 

Week7
(Learning Activities) I learned to write PHP code to modify the website "The Advice Shop site".

(Estimated Hours) 20 hours

(Content Insights) I learned to write PHP code such as "echo", "if/else", "foreach", "function" and "include". I modified the login system, added register.php to save the username and password into
                   the SQLite database. I created a new table "users" in advice.sqlite. When the user logins, he should input the username and password.
          	   

(Career/Employability/Learning Insights) I spent much time improving the login system. Writing/reading the database is a difficult point. I found the new username and password can't be inserted into
                                         the database because I wrote the wrong SQL statement.
