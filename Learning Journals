(Estimated Hours) 8 hours

(Content Insights) I learned to use Joomla with the web hosting CloudAccess.net. I registered a free website https://nostress.joomla.com in joomla.org.
                   A website can be created by the management page https://nostress.joomla.com/administrator/. Without install Joomla on my local computer, the development process is simplified greatly.
				           Creating and publishing a webpage becomes easier. Developers can focus on the website's content.
                   Creating a webpage will use some features in Control Panel like Articles, Modules, Menus, etc. It's different from creating an HTML/CSS webpage. 	   

(Career/Employability/Learning Insights) I spent more time exploring the management page of Joomla and found some useful resource links with screenshots. Searching for useful information is a required skill. 
                                         And much information is redundant. To find the key information quickly is essential. It's helpful to experiment while looking at the guide.
